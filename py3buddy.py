# A simple program to control the Tenx Technology, Inc. iBuddy
# which was sold as a figurine for MSN Messenger to respond to smileys
# sent in MSN Messenger.
#
# It can perform a few actions, such as flashing some LEDs, wiggle and flap its
# wings. It is a really silly device, but it has its uses.
#
# A lot of the information about the protocol is documented in several
# places on the Internet, in drivers (both in Linux kernel space and
# user space for various programs).
#
# iBuddy protocol specific parts were inspired by:
#
# * https://github.com/tietomaakari/ibuddy-lkm (kernel module for Linux)
# * https://github.com/ewall/pybuddy/ (user space)
#
# This program was created as an excuse for me to play with pyusb during
# the 2017 end of year.

# The iBuddy works as follows (according to other people's code):
# * a setup message is sent every time
# * during initialization a reset message is sent
# * commands start with the same 7 byte sequence
# * a reset command at the end to clear everything
#
# The tricky part is that in Python 3 you cannot simply send
# strings, as those are UTF-8 and then things will not work
# as expected. That's why for Python 3 you need to use actual bytes.
#
# The device has a few capabilities that can be set:
# * heart LED
# * head LED (RGB)
# * wings (flap flap)
# * motor (wiggle)
#
# These options need be set in a single byte that is then appended to
# the earlier mentioned message bytes. The bits are as follows:
# * heart LED (bit 7)
# * head LED (bits 4,5,6)
# * wings (bits 2,3)
# * motor (bits 0,1)
#
# To set a capability the relevant bits need to be turned off. The easiest
# way to do this is by distracting integers. The initial value is 0xff (255).
#
# For example to enable the heart LED bit 7 needs to be 0, so
# distract 128 (0b10000000):
#
# hex(0xff - 128) = 0x7f
#
# For this to work the easiest the bits have first to be brought to a known
# state (all 1).
#
# heart LED: 0 is on, 1 is off
# head LED: R is bit 4, G is bit 5, B is bit 6, 0 is on, 1 is off
# wings: 1 is wings high, 2 is wings low (could have been done in 1 bit)
# motor: 0: center (but only after 'turn right', 1: turn left, 2: turn right,
#        3: turn center a bit (but only after 'turn right')
# the setup message

# starts with this particular sequence.
