# py3buddy
Python 3 code to work with the iBuddy MSN figurine released under the GPL-3.0 license.

* py3buddy.py -- main file with class
* py3buddydemo.py -- demo code
* py3buddy.config -- example configuration file
* 99-ibuddy.rules -- udev rules for iBuddy with productid 0x0002

This code was inspired by pybuddy (especially the idea for a macro language),
but no code was copied. The code for pybuddy can be found here (note: the
original Google code site seems to have been gone):

The original version of pybuddy came with the following notice:
