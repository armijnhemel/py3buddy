The original iBuddy software allowed you to define your own actions for smileys
or words sent via MSN Messenger.

The original version of pybuddy also had a macro-like language:
https://github.com/ewall/pybuddy/blob/master/src/pybuddy-daemon.py#L170

In py3buddy support for a macro langage was also added, although slightly
different to the one in pybuddy. I think it is easier (no recursive calls,
easier to specify colours, different types of sleep implemented), but I am
sure that people will disagree with me here.

Commands are colon separated (':'). There are 4 different action categories:

1 heart LED
2 head LED (colour)
3 wiggle
4 wings

plus reset and sleep. There is als a separate 'go' command that will send the
command to the device.

For each of the 4 categories only the last action specified before the command
is executed will count. So if for example you say that the head should be red,
then blue, but no exection command is given, then the head will be blue.

If two commands are executed, but no sleep command is given between the two
commands, then the commands will be executed but perhaps not be noticible.

So two rules of thumb:

1. sleep between each command sequence, or you will possible not see the action
being performed.

2. only use one action from each category

For the heart LED:
* HEART
* NOHEART

For the head LED:
* colour name (NOCOLOUR, RED, BLUE, GREEN, CYAN, YELLOW, PURPLE, WHITE)

For wiggle:
* LEFT
* RIGHT
* MIDDLE
* MIDDLE2 (not a good name)

For wings:
* WINGSHIGH
* WINGSLOW

For sleep:
* SHORTSLEEP
* SLEEP
* LONGSLEEP
* GLACIAL

To execute a command:
* GO

To reset:
* RESET

Example command:

HEART:RED:WINGSLOW:GO:SLEEP:NOHEART:BLUE:WINGSUP:GO:LONGSLEEP:RESET

This will first set the head LED to red, turn on the heart LED and set the
wings in 'high' position. This command is then executed and the program sleeps
a bit. Then it turns off the heart LED, sets the head LED to blue, pulls the
wings down, executes the command, then sleeps for a longer time, before
resetting the device to its initial state (everything off).
